To do notes for application improvement:

- Implement authentication tied to users with proper JWT
- Load the CSV file into database via an sql migration
- Add cucumber e2e tests using gherkin for advanced testing
- Integrate redis for distributed caching
- If omdb response is consistent (ex: boxOffice value doesn't change) => Add omdb response into a movies table for
  lesser API calls
